# Sliding Text Clock - See the time in different languages

Inspired by the Pebble sliding clock the shift clock shifts changes the time by scrolling the old time off the screen and the new time on. You are also able to change language on the fly so you can see the time as written in other languages. Currently only English, French and Japanese are supported

# Hour Strike

![icon](app-icon.png)

Time passes too fast!

This app configures your `Bangle.js` so that it buzzes on the hour or on the half hour.

This app is slightly different from [Hour Chime](https://github.com/espruino/BangleApps/tree/master/apps/widchime). `Hour Chimee` runs as a widget but `Hour Strike` runs as a background task, without showing a widget.

## Features

- Strikes the hour or the half hour
- Set up a quiet time

## Known Issues

1. This app does not know or check whether your clock already chimes on the hour.

## Creator

[Weiming Hu](https://weiming-hu.github.io/), using coding from the [Default Alarm](https://github.com/espruino/BangleApps/tree/master/apps/alarm).

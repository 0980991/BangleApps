# Gadgetbridge Twist Control

Control your music app (e.g. MortPlayer Music [a folder based, not tag based player] ) that handles multiple play-commands (same as using a single-button-headset's button to change songs) on your Gadgetbridge-connected phone.
    • Activate counting for 4 seconds with a twist (beeps at start and end of counting) 
    • twist multiple times for:
      play/pause (1), next song (2), prev. song (3), next folder (4), prev. folder (5), reset counter (6) 
    • the command to be sent is shown in green 
    • Volume up/down is controlled by BTN1/BTN3 presses

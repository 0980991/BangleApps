# Solar Clock

## Introduction

Ever wondered when Sunset really is, what time will it hit? When the Sun will be highest in the sky? When you phone your friend in another country, you can easily find the time, but is it light where they are? The solar clock gives you a pictoral view of the day. It also gives you the opportunity to get the same view on another city in another timezone.
